From January 1942, Y\u016bdachi participated in operations in the Netherlands East Indies, including the invasions of Tarakan, Balikpapan and eastern Java. During the Battle of the Java Sea, Y\u016bdachi engaged a group of Allied destroyers and cruisers. Returning to Subic Bay in the Philippines on 16 March, Y\u016bdachi assisted in the blockade of Manila Bay and the invasion of Cebu, returning to Yokosuka for repairs in early May. During the Battle of Midway on 4\u20136 June, Y\u016bdachi was part of the Midway Occupation Force under the overall command of Admiral Nobutake Kond\u014d.\n\nFrom mid-June, Y\u016bdachi deployed from Kure via Singapore and Mergui for raiding operations in the Indian Ocean, but the operation was cancelled due to reverses suffered by the Imperial Japanese Navy in the Solomon Islands. Y\u016bdachi arrived at Shortland Island on 30 August, and was immediately assigned to \"Tokyo Express\" high speed transport runs to Guadalcanal.\n\nSinking of USS Gregory and USS Little\nIn the night of September 4\u20135, Y\u016bdachi along with the destroyers Hatsuyuki and Murakumo had completed a transport mission running troops and supplies to Guadalcanal, and were preparing a bombardment on Henderson Field, a former Japanese air base which was captured by US forces and being use against Japanese shipping to great effect. They were underway when they encountered the elderly destroyers USS Gregory and USS Little on patrol duty. An American aircraft attempted to silhouette the Japanese ships but dropped five flares too close to the US destroyers, lighting up both ships and resulting in Y\u016bdachi and the other destroyers opening fire.[6]\n\nGregory attempted to fire on the Japanese destroyers, but within just three minutes was blasted by 12.7 cm (5 in) gunfire from the three ships and shot into a floating wreck. Little managed to survive longer, but Y\u016bdachi, Hatsuyuki, and Murakumo quickly switched fire and shelled Little as well, setting her aflame. Both ships began to sink as the Japanese destroyers opened fire at the escaping crew, killing several American sailors. Throughout the engagement, Y\u016bdachi claimed primary credit for both Gregory and Little's sinking.[6][7]\n\nY\u016bdachi continued making missions to Guadalcanal through November, participating briefly in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October under Admiral Takeo Kurita.\n\nNaval battle of Guadalcanal\nMain article: Naval Battle of Guadalcanal\nOn the night of 12\u201313 November 1942, in the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, Y\u016bdachi escorted the Bombardment Force of Rear Admiral Abe Hiroaki. The lead ship in the formation at beginning of battle, Y\u016bdachi had to swerve to avoid U.S. ships, then torpedoed the cruiser USS Portland. Y\u016bdachi then mistook the destroyer USS Sterett for a friendly ship and flashed its recognition signals. Sterett fired back, hitting Y\u016bdachi's #1 boiler room, leaving the ship dead in the water. After Y\u016bdachi was disabled, 207 survivors were removed by Samidare, which then failed to scuttle her with three torpedoes.[8] The abandoned hulk was later sunk by gunfire of Portland, southeast of Savo Island at position (09\u00b014\u2032S 159\u00b052\u2032E). According to James Hornfischer, Y\u016bdachi was showing a white flag before Portland fired (the apparent \"white flag\" was a makeshift sail used in an attempt to get back underway during the battle), but this was deliberately ignored by Captain Laurance T. DuBose, who directed his gunnery officer to \"sink the S.O.B.\".[9]",
